# Project-Library

In this project, I will be creating a simple library that the user can use to manage a list of books they have read or are planning to read. They will be able to add or remove books and mark as read or unread.

<h1>What I learned:</h1>

<ul>
    <li>How to use objects to store a variety of information</li>
    <li>How to use local storage to save user data</li>
    <li>How to push new data into an existing array</li>
    <li>How to manipulate the DOM by creating JavaScript elements</li>
</ul>
